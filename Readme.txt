Roadmap (TBD):  
- [ ] Simultaneous Modern & Classic compatibility
- [ ] Easily extendable sound list in separate file
- [ ] Sounds split into sensible categories
- [ ] Spam prevention (cooldowns)
- [ ] Configurable per-sound attributes (delay, cooldown)
- [ ] In-game options GUI to enable/disable sounds

Optional Extras:  
- [ ] Queue functionality to queue up sounds that trigger in quick overlapping succession?
- [ ] Chain effects? I.e. if triggered several times in a row, start playing a different set of sounds until cooldown period is over ("Stop clicking me!)
