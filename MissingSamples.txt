Missing samples that I've noticed while writing the addon:


* "Out of / Not enough Maelstrom"	For Elem & Enh Shaman specs
* "Out of / Not enough Fury"		For both Demon Hunter specs
* "Can't do that / Can't attack while Frozen"
* "Can't do that / Can't attack while disoriented"
* "Can't do that / Can't attack while polymorphed"
